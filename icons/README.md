# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the extension icons in the following sizes:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

You can create icons using any image editor. The icons should:

1. Be simple and recognizable at small sizes
2. Use the extension's color scheme (blues: #4a90e2)
3. Represent grocery shopping or price comparison
4. Be saved as PNG with transparency

## Suggested Design Ideas

- Shopping cart with price tag
- Calculator with grocery items
- Price comparison chart
- Unit measurement symbols (oz, lb)

## Temporary Workaround

Until proper icons are created, you can use placeholder icons or the extension will use Chrome's default icon.

To create simple placeholder icons quickly:
1. Use an online icon generator
2. Use a design tool like Figma, Canva, or GIMP
3. Export in the required sizes
